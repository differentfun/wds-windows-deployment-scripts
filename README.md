# üõ†Ô∏è Windows Deployment Scripts (MBR & GPT)

Collection of batch scripts to automate the partitioning, capturing, and deployment of Windows using `.wim` images, supporting both **MBR (BIOS/Legacy)** and **GPT (UEFI)** partitioning styles.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** These scripts will erase all data on the selected disk or partition. Use with extreme caution.

## üß± Requirements

- Windows PE / recovery environment or similar
- Administrator privileges
- A valid `.wim` Windows image (e.g. from installation media)
- DiskPart, DISM, BCDBoot, and BootSect (all included in Windows PE)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### 1. Prepare USB with WinPE + Scripts
Place these scripts and the `.wim` file on a USB stick or external drive.

### 2. Boot into WinPE
Boot the target machine using your prepared USB or recovery ISO.

### 3. Run the Scripts

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è GPT (UEFI) Workflow
```bat
GPT_Partitioner.bat
```
- Cleans and partitions the selected disk using GPT
- Creates EFI, MSR, and Windows partitions

```bat
GPT_WimApplier.bat
```
- Prompts for WIM path, image index, partition letters
- Applies the image and configures UEFI boot

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è MBR (BIOS) Workflow
```bat
MBR_Partitioner.bat
```
- Cleans and partitions the selected disk using MBR
- Creates System Reserved and Windows partitions

```bat
MBR_WimApplier.bat
```
- Prompts for WIM path, image index, partition letters
- Applies the image and configures BIOS boot
- Rewrites MBR boot code with bootsect

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Capture a WIM Image
```bat
WimCapturer.bat
```
- Prompts for the source drive, destination path, name, and description
- Captures the selected partition into a `.wim` file using DISM



#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers
- These scripts are provided as-is and should be tested in a safe environment before use in production.
- Always double-check disk numbers and drive letters before proceeding.
- No warranty is provided. Use at your own risk.
